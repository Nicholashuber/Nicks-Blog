PipControl is a Chrome Extention with over 800+ users that allows you to watch videos in a floating window that is always ontop so you can keep an eye on what you want while interacting with websites or applications.\
\
This project started from a need. A need to watch youtube videos or movies whille working or researching. \
Enter...The World Wide Web Consortium (**W3C**).

The very people that define the web standards of the very internet we are on had this same need. They developed the protocols to allow browsers to utilize these events in a brand new way. Unfortently. Barely any websites develop cool ui experinces that utilize this quality of life update. \
\
Having researched this I had the eureka moment to develop a browser extension to fill in that gap! No matter the website the extension contains my ES11 Javascript code to tap into the dom of the website and pop out any main video element on the page.

* Notify the Extension when it enters and leaves Picture-in-Picture mode.
* Allow the Extension to trigger Picture-in-Picture mode via a user gesture on a video element.
* Allow the Extension to know the size of the Picture-in-Picture window and notify the Extension when it changes.
* Allow the Extension to exit Picture-in-Picture mode.
* Allow the Extension to check if Picture-in-Picture mode can be triggered.
