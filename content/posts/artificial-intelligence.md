Ahh the wonders of not having to think or do anymore! Why not create another intelligence to do it for you? Well hold your horses we aren't there yet. But what we do have is Visual, Text, and Functional AI to name a few I know of.

Visual AI that uses deep learning or datasets to determine what object is currently being seen visually by a device. Ai can pick up and label each object accordingly. For instance self driving cars use this type of Ai to determine what objects are around and how they act to take action on. I've used this in a project where I detected fish in a fish tank. I'd randomly generate fake coins every hour at certain grid points in the tank. Every time a fish would swim over the coin they get a point.

Ai that consumes and can generate meaningful text is one of the most exciting to me. One of the most advanced models in the artificial community is GPT-3
