eJS and deployed to heroku my twitter is now 100% automated and gains me a ton of new followers a week. It retweets popular tags I specify and automatically thanks people for following.\

My Twitter Bot project has been a really fun experience. I created a bot that pretends to be me on twitter! Do you even have to ask why? Twitter sucks! Thankfully my bot has blended in really well and still runs to this day! I've gained over +3,000 followers since running and forgetting about it. It works by retweeting popular posts in niche / trending communities. One example I use is #100daysofcode. Many members really appreciate if you retweet their contributions.

I built this Twitter bot in NodeJS and deployed to Heroku using a server-less architecture. My twitter is now 100% automated and gains me a ton of followers daily. Now I can drink margarites on the beach while unbeknownst to me gain followers & advertise myself! Woo!!
