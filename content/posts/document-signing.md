Do you or your business need a way to sign documents in a secure manner? You're in luck! You have some options to choose from. Docusign, Hellosign and SignNow are some of the competing platforms just to name a few.

When choosing between these platforms I've come to realize some questions to ask. Are signatures going to be requested by someone talking with the user OR is this an automated process invoked by a user via an interface? These will help narrow down the choices tremendously beyond just the platforms you are currently using.

Are you running a business where you need to reach out the users? When a rep is on the phone both docusign and hellosign have great integrations with Salesforce and a variety of other platforms. They surface a widget that you can place on any view and enable your employees to send out the document mapped out to use their information.
